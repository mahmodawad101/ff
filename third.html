            <h3>Who is Procyon b?</h3>
            <p>It is the white dwarf companion in the Procyon star
                system. To review, a white dwarf is a remnant of a dying
                star with an average mass like the Sun</p>

            <h3>So what happens at the end of Procyon life?</h3>
            <p>At the endpoint of its lives, stars like this swell and expel
                their other layers which creates a beautiful planetary
                nebula. When the outer layer is expelled, what remains is
                a white dwarf—a very hot and dense core of the former
                star.</p>
            <h3>What is the classification of proyon according to the
                spectrum?</h3>
            <p>Procyon B has a spectral class of DQZ. It is very faint,
                with an apparent magnitude of only 10.7, way past the
                naked-eye limiting magnitude which is around 6.5
                apparent magnitude.
                In a comparison between Procyon b and our sun ,who
                will in?
                This white dwarf star only has 0.6 times the solar mass
                and 0.01 of the Sun’s radius. Because it is a relatively small object, it also has very low luminosity
                (0.00049
                Suns).
                The parent star of Procyon B was likely about three times
                as massive as the Sun. This progenitor star came at the
                end of its stellar life around 1.19 billion years ago
            </p>
            <h3>So what about Procyon temp and his energy?</h3>
            <p>As a white-hot core of a dying star, Procyon B has a
                surface temperature of 7,740 K which is hotter than
                Procyon A. However, it is no longer generating energy
                and is only shining through residual heat. It will continue
                to cool over time until it no longer emits heat or light. By
                this time, it will become a black dwarf.As a white-hot core of a dying star, Procyon B has a

            <h3>What is Sirius b</h3>
            <p>It is the white dwarf companion in the sirius star system
                was a large white star five times as massive as the
                sun, but it has since passed through the red giant
                phase. Now, it’s the dead remnant of a formerly
                active star.
            </p>
            <h3>How does the star die?</h3>
            <p>It was once a main-sequence star, like Sirius A. Then
                it swelled into a red giant and shrank into a white
                dwarf. White dwarfs cool and fade as they age.
                From Sirius B's mass and temperature (25,000
                kelvins), the astronomers estimate the star became
                a white dwarf around 124 million years ago</p>
            <h3>What is the classification of Sirius according to the
                spectrum?</h3>
            <p>It has spectral type DA2
                So what about sirius tempreture?
                , has surface average temperatures of around
                25,000 K. This is more than four times as hot as our
                Sun. Sirius B is more than 100,000 times fainter
                than Sirius A
                The white dwarf, Sirius B, is the first white dwarf to
                be discovered. Sirius rotates at a speed of 16 km/s. It is the first
                star to have its velocity measured. This happened in
                1868.</p>
            <h3>So how can we find Sirius b?</h3>
            <p>Sirius is rising in the southeast in the hours after
                midnight. You can find Sirius looking in the south at
                dawn. Sirius will be the brightest star in the night
                sky for the next 210,000 years. Over the next 60,000
                years, Sirius will get even closer to Earth, and thus it
                will become even brighter</p>
